      <p>Hi, I'm Ivana Bustamante Rojo — Bilingual Journalist and Editor</p>
      
      <p>I'm a journalism major with a minor in editing and publishing, who aspires to tell meaningful stories through both words and design. I am a writer for the Spanish section of San Diego State University's newspaper, The Daily Aztec. I aim to cover campus culture from a perspective my Latino audience can better relate and understand. My main goal in this field is to always offer a voice to communities who don't have the privilege to use theirs.</p>
      
      <p>I've also enjoyed working on SDSU's student-run magazine, The Look, bringing creative ideas to life on a page to tell a story.</p>
      
      <p>This site is a hub for my work — writing clips, editorial projects, and creative experiments. Thanks for visiting, and feel free to reach out or connect!</p>
